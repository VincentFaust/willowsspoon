# Shopify ETL 

During the pandemic, my partner and I cofounded on a small business specializing in crafting homemade, fresh dog cookies and jerky. Our passion for creating these treats stemmed from our own experiences making them for our beloved pets. 

We this idea might not have the potential for massive growth or scalability, but our primary motivation was building something from scratch and sharing other dog lovers.
